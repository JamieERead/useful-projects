# useful-projects

Here are some useful code snippets and projects that you can copy into your project. Licence free.

You might have seen a coding example from me on Instagram or Tiktok. 

In the video description you should see a link to the folder containing the code. In this format for example:

`useful-projects/60-second-course`
